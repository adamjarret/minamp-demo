This is a live demo of the [minamp](https://github.com/adamjarret/minamp) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

The minamp theme is intended to be a blank canvas for [AMP](https://ampproject.org) sites.
It is focused on versatility and reducing the pain of loading styles and AMP component scripts from different scopes.

This example site features a sidebar and photo gallery as an illustration of how the theme can be customized.
